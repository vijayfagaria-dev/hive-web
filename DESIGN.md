# 🏠 Hive — Flat Fine & Bills Bot

> Single source of truth for the project. This is the distilled output of the

## What it is

A **personal Telegram bot** that runs a shared flat for 4–6 friends: it holds the
house rules, logs fines, tracks a common "fine pot," splits the four recurring
bills, and chases dues until they're paid. Plus a delightful guest experience and
tap-to-open NFC stickers around the flat.

**The one principle that drives every decision:**

> **The bot is the *ledger*, the wallet is the *jar*, and the two only ever touch read-only.**
> The app records and calculates. It never holds or moves money.

## Why we built our own (instead of an existing app)

The exact combo we want — a neutral fine pot + our own rules/fines + only four
specific bills + dues + one-tap logging + guest access + NFC — isn't sold as a
single product. Every off-the-shelf tool (Splitwise, Grist, Notion, neobank jars)
nails one slice and misses the rest. So: build it, own it, ₹0 to run.

## Money: custody vs tracking (the hard rule)

- **Custody** = a throwaway "fridge-QR" wallet (a fresh Fi/Jupiter/Paytm account
  used *only* for the pot). It physically holds the fine cash. Neutrality comes
  from it being nobody's personal account + full transparency, not from tech locks.
- **Tracking** = this app. It gets **read-only** sight of money arriving and
  updates the ledger.
- **We do NOT build a wallet.** Holding INR in custody is RBI-licensed PPI territory.
- **Account Aggregator** (India's official read-only banking rail) is perfect in
  theory but **closed to individual devs** (only RBI/SEBI/IRDAI/PFRDA-regulated
  entities can be a Financial Information User). Ruled out.
- **Read-only ingestion options**, in order of preference:
  1. **Manual** — the `/fine` action *is* the record; reconcile against the wallet
     weekly. (Start here.)
  2. **SMS forwarding** — a forwarder (MacroDroid/Tasker) on the wallet phone POSTs
     bank-credit SMS to the app; it parses the amount + UPI note and ticks the fine paid.
  3. **Email receipts** — Gmail API on the read-only scope parses wallet emails.
  - Optional "real API" path: collect via a payment gateway (Razorpay/Cashfree)
    instead of a raw wallet — but that adds KYC/fees. Overkill for a small pot.

## Stack (decided)

| Piece | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hosting | **Oracle Cloud Always Free** VM | Real Linux box, free *forever*, runs bot + DB on one machine |
| Backend / API | **FastAPI** (Python 3.11+) | Telegram webhook + a **JSON API** at `/api/*` (`app/api.py`) consumed by the frontend |
| Bot lib | **aiogram 3** | Async, pairs cleanly with FastAPI |
| DB | **SQLite** (via `aiosqlite`) | Tiny, zero-maintenance; 100 rules / years of data is nothing |
| Frontend | **Next.js 16** (App Router, TypeScript) | `frontend/` — Tailwind v4 + shadcn (Base UI) + Framer Motion + TanStack Query + Zod contract; Next proxies `/api` → FastAPI (same-origin cookie auth). _(Supersedes the original Jinja2 plan — see note below.)_ |
| Money | Throwaway fridge-QR wallet | Read-only link via SMS/email parse (or manual) |

> **Architecture note (updated):** the web UI was originally Jinja2 templates rendered by FastAPI. It is now a standalone **Next.js frontend** (a deliberate, product-owner-driven upgrade for a polished, animated experience). FastAPI kept all its logic and simply gained a JSON API; the Jinja routes are retired once the frontend fully replaces them.

Alternative hosting if you'd rather not babysit a VM: **Cloudflare Workers + D1**
(serverless, never sleeps — but bot would be JS). **Railway** is easiest deploy
(~$0–5/mo credit, no cold starts). Avoid Render free (spin-down) and Supabase as
the sole DB (pauses after 7 days idle).

## The two faces (one backend)

```
   Telegram chat  ─┐
   (tap buttons)   │
                   ├──►  ONE FastAPI app  ──►  SQLite
   Web pages      ─┘            │
   (dashboard,                  └──►  reads wallet credits (SMS/email, read-only)
    guest, NFC)
```

- **Bot** = the fast lane for *input* and quick checks. Tap-driven (inline
  keyboards), not command-memorizing. Lives in the flat's group chat. Free push
  notifications.
- **Dashboard / web** = the *overview & management* (tables, history, editing the
  100-rule list, month-end settle). The thing chat is bad at.
- Both read the same SQLite, so they're never out of sync.

**Open decision:** dashboard as a **Telegram Mini App** (opens inside Telegram,
reuses Telegram identity, no login to build — *recommended*) vs a **standalone
web page / PWA** (bookmark, but build a tiny login).

## Data model

```sql
members (
  id, name, telegram_id,
  role,            -- 'tenant' | 'guest'
  is_active,       -- in the house right now?
  joined_on, left_on,
  host_id          -- which tenant invited this guest (null for tenants)
)

rules (
  id, category, text, fine_amount,
  is_favorite,     -- surfaces as a quick button in the bot
  use_count,       -- self-tunes: most-fined rules bubble up
  severity_tier,   -- low fines = lazy-consensus; high = needs confirm/vote
  auto_confirm
)

fines (
  id, member_id, rule_id, amount, ts,
  added_by,        -- who reported it (accuser accountability)
  status,          -- 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'disputed' | 'void' | 'upheld'
  paid,
  confirm_deadline,
  dispute_reason
)

fine_votes (id, fine_id, voter_id, vote)   -- only for disputed fines

bills (id, type, total, month, paid_by, ts)   -- type: rent|house_help|electricity|water

bill_shares (id, bill_id, member_id, share_amount, paid)   -- POINT-IN-TIME SNAPSHOT
```

**Pot** = `sum(fines.amount where status='confirmed'/'upheld')` minus what's applied to rent.
**Dues** = unpaid confirmed fines + unpaid bill_shares.

## Roles & lifecycle

- **Tenant** = full member: in rent/bill splits, can fine anyone, pay, manage rules.
- **Guest** = lightweight, temporary: subject to fines, can view rules / report /
  pay — but **NOT in rent/bill splits** (guests don't pay rent). Removable / expiring.
- Keep permissions flat for 4 friends — every tenant can do everything; add an
  admin role only if you ever need one.

**The one gotcha that matters — splits must be point-in-time.** Never compute
`rent ÷ count(active tenants)` live, or adding a 5th person silently rewrites
everyone's *past* rent. On each bill, **snapshot** one `bill_shares` row per
currently-active tenant. June stays ÷4 forever even after July splits ÷6.
**Build `bill_shares` in from v1 — it's the one thing you can't cleanly retrofit.**

## Picking 1 rule out of 100 (selection at scale)

Storing 100 rules is trivial (SQLite). The challenge is *selecting* one fast.
Never show 100 buttons. Four tricks:

1. **Favorites first** — ~10 ⭐ rules cause 90% of fines; show them as quick buttons.
2. **Browse by category** — 8 categories × ~12 rules, drill-down.
3. **Search / inline type-ahead** — Telegram inline mode, scales to 1000 rules.
4. **Fuzzy text fallback** — `fine rohit dishes` matches and confirms.

Plus the slick one: **NFC location pre-filters the rules** (see below) — tap the
sticker where the crime happened and only that spot's rules show.

Managing the 100 rules = a searchable, categorized **table on the dashboard**
(literally the Excel sheet, imported once). Never manage 100 rules in chat.

## Handling fine-system abuse (frivolous / "for fun" reports)

Core principle: **a reported fine is a *claim*, not a *verdict*.** Make the honest
path frictionless, the abusive path visible and costly, and let humans resolve.
Keep *disputing* one tap (if contesting is expensive, people pay unjust fines —
which rewards the abuser). Five layers; most reports settle at Layer 1:

1. **Cooling window + lazy consensus** — a pending fine auto-confirms after ~12–24h
   *unless* the accused (or anyone) taps **Dispute**. Real fines sail through;
   joke fines get frozen.
2. **Dispute → neutral majority vote** — members who are neither reporter nor
   accused tap Uphold/Void. Tie/no-quorum → **void** (benefit of the doubt).
3. **Accuser accountability** (the anti-spam teeth):
   - **Loser-pays** — a voted-down fine flips into a "false alarm" fine on the *reporter*.
   - **Public overturn rate** — everyone sees each member's reports filed/upheld/overturned.
   - **Lose the fast-lane** — high overturn rate → all your fines require a vote up front.
4. **Rate limits & severity tiers** — cap reports/person/day; no repeat fine on the
   same person+rule within a few hours; small fines auto-confirm, big fines need a
   co-sign or vote.
5. **Human layer** — monthly meeting (over beers) clears disputes, reviews the
   overturn leaderboard, retunes rules. Meta-rule: *abusing the system is the most
   expensive fine of all.*

**Recommended starting config:** ≤₹50 auto-confirm after 12h unless disputed;
>₹50 needs accept-or-one-cosign within 24h else vote; overturned report = ₹50 on
the reporter + logged to their stat; max ~5 reports/person/day; no repeat
person+rule within 6h; overturn rate >40% → all fines need a vote.

**Honest meta-point:** you can't fully solve this in software and shouldn't try —
among friends, a public "biggest false-reporter 🏆" stat does more than any
algorithm. Ship Layer 1 + visible overturn stat + loser-pays first; add voting
only if someone games it.

## The delight layer 😄

**Guest welcome page** (shared link or NFC tap): personalized welcome ("Amit's told
us you're trouble 😏"), a few flat photos, a fun **Hall of Shame** leaderboard,
rules written like a menu (emojis + amounts), and actions: *I'll behave / Report /
Pay*. Optional flexes: a "guest pass" card, a "days survived without a fine" counter.
It's a templated HTML page off the same backend.

**NFC stickers** around the flat (~₹300 for a pack of NTAG213 stickers, written
once with the free "NFC Tools" app and locked):

| Spot | Tap → opens | Clever bit |
|---|---|---|
| 🚪 Front door | Guest welcome page | Instant smile on arrival |
| 🧊 Fridge | Pay screen + pot status | Money lives where snacks live |
| 🚰 Kitchen sink | Report a fine, **pre-filtered to kitchen rules** | Location = category filter |
| 🚬 Balcony | Smoking rules + report | Tap right where it happens |
| 📺 Living room | Full dashboard / Hall of Shame | The "control room" tap |
| 🚽 Bathroom | Cleanliness rules + report | Self-explanatory |

- Android reads NFC URLs by default; iPhone XS+ reads them natively (tap → banner → Safari). No app needed.
- Each sticker holds a URL like `hive.app/s/kitchen`; the backend route `/s/<spot>`
  renders that spot's contextual page. Same sticker shows the **dashboard to a
  logged-in tenant** and the **guest view to a stranger**.

## Build order

1. **v1 (MVP):** tenants only · rules + favorites/categories/search · `/fine` →
   pot · bill split with **`bill_shares` snapshots from day one** · dues ·
   `/pot` `/dues`. Fine workflow = Layer 1 (cooling window) + visible overturn stat.
2. **v2:** guest role + read-only guest welcome page + guest self-pay · NFC `/s/<spot>` routes.
3. **v3:** add/remove-tenant invites + leave flow · dispute voting + loser-pays +
   reputation downgrade · month-end auto-summary · auto read-only money ingest (SMS/email).

Don't gold-plate. Ship v1; add the rest only if you're still using it.

## Explicit non-goals

- ❌ The app holding/moving money (RBI-licensed territory — the wallet does custody).
- ❌ Account Aggregator (closed to individual devs).
- ~~❌ A heavy frontend framework — Jinja2 pages + the bot are the whole UI.~~ **(reversed)** — the web UI is now a polished **Next.js** frontend over the FastAPI JSON API. The Telegram bot remains a first-class, separate input surface.
- ❌ Splitting arbitrary expenses — only rent, house help, electricity, water.
- ❌ A courtroom for 4 friends — social pressure is the real enforcer.

## Still open / TODO before scaffolding code

- [ ] Dashboard as **Telegram Mini App** vs standalone web page (lean: Mini App).
- [ ] Paste the actual **rules + fines list** (or the Excel) to seed `rules`.
- [ ] Pick the flat name (placeholder: "Hive") + grab a domain or use a free subdomain.
- [ ] Create the throwaway wallet + grab its UPI QR.
- [ ] Create the Telegram bot via @BotFather, get the token.
